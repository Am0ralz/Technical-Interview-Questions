https://leetcode.com/problems/assign-cookies

https://leetcode.com/problems/is-subsequence

https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-arrows-to-burst-balloons

(A bit harder) https://leetcode.com/problems/partition-labels


Binary search

https://leetcode.com/problems/peak-index-in-a-mountain-array


Sorting
https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-anagram
https://leetcode.com/problems/array-partition-i
https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-intervals


Use sorting, not a multiset (we will look at multisets next week!): https://leetcode.com/problems/find-all-anagrams-in-a-string

Simple recursion

https://leetcode.com/problems/powx-n

Recursion and memoization (make sure you use memoization for the problems below)

https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock
https://leetcode.com/problems/edit-distance
https://leetcode.com/problems/house-robber-ii

Do not use a built-in regex for this one! https://leetcode.com/problems/regular-expression-matching/

Dynamic Programming (same problems but use dynamic programming now!)

https://leetcode.com/problems/powx-n

https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock

https://leetcode.com/problems/edit-distance

https://leetcode.com/problems/house-robber-ii
