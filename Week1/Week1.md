Week 1 - Basics of Coding And Math
Goals
By the end of this week, students should have their language of choice for the program and for the interviews selected, and should be comfortable writing basic code in that language, as well as handle arrays, basic mathematics, simple bitwise operations, and simple string manipulation with ease and comfortably.

Bonus: Learn how to implement union-find data structure and solve problems using it.

Topics
Arrays

Basic math

Simple string manipulation

Simple bitwise manipulation

Space and time complexity analysis basics, becoming comfortable with big-O analysis

Union find

Sessions
Discussion on language choice

Session on soft skills, confidence, handling failure, etc.
