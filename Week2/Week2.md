Multisets in Python: The collections.Counter class

This is a very powerful class to know how to use. Some interview problems can be solved in only a few lines of code if you know how to use this class. Some interviewers might consider it almost cheating to use this class (that's how useful it is!) and might ask you to not use it, or ask you to show that you know how it works. Make sure you know how it works and that you could implement an equivalent class if needed. A good exercise would be to implement your own Counter class that imitates collections.Counter using a dictionary as the underlying structure.

Multisets: Unfortunately Java does not come with a multiset class. You will have to use a HashMap<T, Integer> and manually implement any of the multiset operations you need. (For real world applications, you can use Google's Guava library which comes with a multiset class but I do not recommend using this for coding interviews as interviewers are likely to be unfamiliar with it, and you are generally expected to only use standard language features and libraries only.)

Multiset

Make sure to use a multiset for this one (as opposed to sorting): https://leetcode.com/problems/find-all-anagrams-in-a-string

This one has a few “clever” solutions but feel free to us a simple multi-set solution: https://leetcode.com/problems/set-mismatch

Challenge question: this one is more difficult than the average interview question but it is good exercise! You will need to build a simple parser in addition to using multisets. https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-atoms
