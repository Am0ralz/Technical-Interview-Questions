Week 4 - Heaps, stacks, queues

Goals


Students should be comfortable writing programs to generate basics sets of combinatorial objects such as all subsets of a set, all strings given an alphabet, all permutations, and all combinations. Ideally they should also be able to provide solutions that do not use exponential space and that are at worst linear amortized time. They should also be able to notice problems requiring backtracking and write simple backtracking programs.
