Week 5 - Trees and Graphs
Goals
Students should be comfortable noticing when a problem is a tree or graph problem, and building a tree or graph data structure given inputs (this almost always requires using hash maps) quickly and efficiently. Students should also become very comfortable doing basic traversals (DFS, BFS), and ideally be relatively comfortable implementing some more advanced algorithms such as topological sort, shortest path, and minimum spanning trees.

This is a heavily algorithmic week. Students who are weak in algorithms will be well-served to check out this app: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=wiki.algorithm.algorithms
